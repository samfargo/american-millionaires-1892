                In June 1892, The Tribune Association published American Millionaires, a
                special issue of The Tribune Monthly that attempted to identify every
                person in the United States "reputed to be worth a million or more,"
                along with the industries in which those fortunes were made. Compiled
                through nationwide correspondence and local reporting, it represents one
                of the earliest systematic efforts to document the geography and sources
                of American wealth.

                This website preserves that material into structured,
                accessible data. Each entry is carefully transcribed and made searchable by name, place, and occupation while
                retaining the original language of the source.

                Because the Tribune relied on investigative journalism rather than audited accounts,
                the list reflects contemporary perception as much as financial fact. For
                that reason, the dataset is presented not as a definitive measure,
                but as a historically significant record of wealth in the Gilded Age.
